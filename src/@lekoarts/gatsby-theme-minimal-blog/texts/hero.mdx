A Software Engineer & Architect.

I'm an Australian who enjoys strumming the guitar, 
Muay Thai, and has a weakness for bacon & egg rolls on 
a Saturday morning.

I also love building things and to scratch that itch,
I tinker with [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/), [Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org) with a focus 
on System Design. I do consume a lot of startup oriented content from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) but the stuff here is [just for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev).

Currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Azenix](https://www.azenix.com.au)
