A Software Engineer & Architect.

I'm an Australian who enjoys strumming the guitar, 
Muay Thai, and has a weakness for bacon & egg rolls on 
a Saturday morning.

I love building things and to scratch that itch,
I tinker with [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/), [Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) and [React](https://reactjs.org) with a focus 
on System Design.
