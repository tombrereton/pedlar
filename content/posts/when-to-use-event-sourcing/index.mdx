## What is Event Sourcing
Instead of only storing the current state and mutating it, we store state as a sequence of events (or changes).
A good way to visualize it is your current bank balance and past transactions. Let's say you start with $0, you deposit $100, 
then you spend $30. This leaves you with $70. In Event Sourcing, each transaction (i.e. deposit and spend) is an `event`
and to get the current state we combine them all ($0 + $100 - $30 = $70).

## Core Concepts
- Events represent something that happened in the past. For example, `MoneyDeposited` not a command like `DepisotMoney`, 
events are more scalable whereas commands are tightly coupled to the downstream component.
- You need an Event Store to store your events, for example a database.
- Downstream components can subscribe to the Events.
- You can map the data of events into different views, for example a table representing the top 10 bank transactions. 
In Event Sourcing terms, this is called a materialised view.
- Application code for generating events is seperate to code which subscribes to events (strong decoupling).

## When To Use Event Sourcing
**Problem**: Reading & writing with the same system can slow performance and limit 
scability as the same system is handling both these jobs.<br/>
**Solution**: Event sourcing uses separate systems to write & read the data.

**Problem**: Multiple processes updating the same row of data can either lead to 
corrupted data or degraded performance due to data locking.<br/>
**Solution**: Event Sourcing appends events so there is no need to lock data.

**Problem**: Sometimes we want to know how we reached our current state e.g. 
if the price of a t-shirt was $100 but is now $40. Without Event Sourcing 
we would only know that it's $40 but not what it was previously or why it's now $40.<br/>
**Solution**: With Event Sourcing we store a series of events with metadata e.g. 
"Initial Price: $100", then "Reduced Price for Clearance: $40". 
Using a series of events allows us to understand how we reached our current state.

**Problem**: Regular data stores have no built-in audit trail.<br/>
**Solution**: Storing a series of events provides a natural audit trail.
