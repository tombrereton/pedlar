## Who Am I? 
I’m a Software Engineer & Architect with extensive experience
building websites, APIs and back end services in .NET & Microsoft Azure. 
From my years at ASOS I also have experience with working at high scale and on critical apis,
which handle millions of users per day. In more recent years as a consultant, I’ve worked
with businesses of all shapes and sizes to help them reach their highest
potential through increased online visibility, and providing elegant and
effective solutions. After building up lots of valuable experience in London, I made the decision to move 
back to Sydney, Australia in early 2022.

## Why Do I Love It?

My experiences, both educationally and professionally, have led
me to successfully enable small to large sized
companies run their business in the cloud, which can not only reduce costs
but increase sales and visibility. I enjoy developing relationships with new
people and providing efficient and elegant solutions to
empower their businesses to reach their highest potential

## How Did I Get Here?

Whilst studying and working as a structural engineer I developed a
strong interest in programming when automating structural
engineering calculations. After becoming infatuated with the
intricacies of programming, I made my move into software
engineering where my interest has matured into a passion for helping businesses
grow through building elegant websites, creating them an online presence and bespoke cloud-based software solutions.
