## Who Am I? 
I’m a Software Engineer & Architect with extensive experience
building websites, APIs and back end services in .NET & Microsoft Azure. This
experience includes working as a software engineer at ASOS, an e-commerce
company which handles millions of user per day. As a consultant, I’ve worked
with businesses of all shapes and sizes to help them reach their highest
potential through increased online visibility, and providing elegant and
effective solutions. With a Masters in Computer Science from the University of
Birmingham and having worked in both Australia and the UK, I’m able to provide
specialised services in line with your needs.

## Why Do I Love It?

My experiences, both educationally and professionally, have led
me to successfully enable small to large sized
businesses run their business in the cloud, which can not only reduce costs
but increase sales and presence. I enjoy developing relationships with new
people and providing efficient and elegant solutions to
empower their businesses to reach their highest potential

## How Did I Get Here?

Whilst studying and working as a structural engineer I developed a
strong interest in programming when automating structural
engineering calculations. After becoming infatuated with the
intricacies of programming, I made my move into software
engineering where my interest has matured into a passion for helping businesses
grow through building elegant websites, creating them an online presence and bespoke cloud-based software solutions.
